# Snake-Game

### Used libraries:
- Pygame (install with 'pip install pygame')

### Code overview:
- Setting up the screen
- Setting up game variables
- Defining functions for:
  - Drawing snake body
  - Showing game over screen
  - Showing score
- Running main loop:
  - Checking for events
  - Checking for cases where game stops
  - Moving snake and food
- Quitting the app

---
### To be done:
- There is unused snake_body list and that is in there because I'll try to backup snake body growth in a different way.
- I also plan on adding more comments, organizing game variables better and maybe put main logic/loop in a separate function.
- Also need to write user instruction on the Game Over screen so the user can know that he/she is able to press n to start the game again or press q to quit.

This is one of the first projects I've done without any tutorials. 
Only used Pygame documentation for a few things and that's it.
Although it can be worked more on this project, I am really proud of it because I've learned some usefull stuff like writing basic game logic, using arrays to backup parts of the game, using pygame module, etc.
